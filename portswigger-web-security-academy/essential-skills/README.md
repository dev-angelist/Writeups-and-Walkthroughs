# Essential skills

In this section, you'll learn some broadly applicable skills that will help you to apply what you've learned from our labs to other live targets. We cover a range of general tips and tricks, as well as how to use some of Burp's lesser-known features to optimize your workflow. We've also provided some additional labs, so you can test these out for yourself.
