## Install & Configure Burp Suite

### Quick Method

In my case I installed Burp Suite Community Edition and Chromium on my main machine (Debian OS), by starting BurpSuite and clicking on Proxy -> Intercept -> Open Browser (orange button) it is possible to have Chromium already set for use and communicating directly with Burp.

## Learning Paths

As suggested into HexDump BSCP Technical Guide there's not the methodology and the order of you path is subjective, you can use the existing learning paths, proceed with individual modules, do all the lab apprentice first etc, below is the table relating to a possible personalized study path: [https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/tech/bscp-technical-guide/](https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/tech/bscp-technical-guide/)
