# File upload vulnerabilities

## What are file upload vulnerabilities?

File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.

In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server.

## Exploiting unrestricted file uploads to deploy a web shell

From a security perspective, the worst possible scenario is when a website allows you to upload server-side scripts, such as PHP, Java, or Python files, and is also configured to execute them as code. This makes it trivial to create your own web shell on the server.

### **Web shell**

A web shell is a malicious script that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a remote web server simply by sending HTTP requests to the right endpoint.

If you're able to successfully upload a web shell, you effectively have full control over the server. This means you can read and write arbitrary files, exfiltrate sensitive data, even use the server to pivot attacks against both internal infrastructure and other servers outside the network. For example, the following PHP one-liner could be used to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem:

`<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>`

Once uploaded, sending a request for this malicious file will return the target file's contents in the response.

A more versatile web shell may look something like this:

`<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>`

This script enables you to pass an arbitrary system command via a query parameter as follows:

`GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1`

## Exploiting flawed validation of file uploads

In the wild, it's unlikely that you'll find a website that has no protection against file upload attacks like we saw in the previous lab. But just because defenses are in place, that doesn't mean that they're robust. You can sometimes still exploit flaws in these mechanisms to obtain a web shell for remote code execution.

### Flawed file type validation

When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in a `POST` request with the content type `application/x-www-form-url-encoded`. This is fine for sending simple text like your name or address. However, it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an entire image file or a PDF document. In this case, the content type `multipart/form-data` is preferred.

### Flawed file type validation

Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting such a form might result in a request that looks something like this:

```html
POST /images HTTP/1.1
    Host: normal-website.com
    Content-Length: 12345
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg

    [...binary content of example.jpg...]

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

    This is an interesting description of my image.

    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

    wiener
    ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--
```

As you can see, the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a `Content-Disposition` header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own `Content-Type` header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.
